# CLIP-ALIGN_ZeroShotLearning_RealEstate
this repository Implements Zeroshot learning on a custom dataset of real-estate images (which could be replaced with any data) for TextToImage retrieval tasks. This repository contains a .ipynb (instead of.py) to help the process be more descriptive, but you can use it in .py format too (if you only want to see the final result)
##### Note: the data used is private and cannot be shared but there is no limit to it

# How to use
Just make a copy of the .ipynb file and try to run the cells :) if you want to use a .py file you should install the libraries installed at the first cell. Also, edit the path to your target images
##### Note: if you want to use CPU instead of GPU you should install a GPU version of the 'faiss' library (use the command below)

```bash
pip install faiss-cpu 
```
