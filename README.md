# CLIP-ALIGN_ZeroShotLearning_RealEstate
this repository Implements Zeroshot learning on a custom dataset of real-estate images (which could be replaced with any data) for TextToImage retrieval tasks. This repository contains a .ipynb (instead of.py) to help the process be more descriptive, but you can use it in .py format too (if you only want too see the final result)
##### Note: the data that is used is private and cannot be shared but there is no limit to it
